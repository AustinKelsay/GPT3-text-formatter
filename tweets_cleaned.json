{"prompt": "", "completion": "So:\n\ud83d\udd0d we can prove a transaction is positive-sum if we observe the reserve price\n\ud83e\udd77 but before crypto, reserve prices mostly unobservable\n\ud83d\udcca after crypto, we'll get order books for everything\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f &amp; order books make reserve prices observable\n\ud83d\udca1 prove more transactions positive-sum"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "The key insight is that crypto is introducing explicit order books into many more markets. Right now that's digital goods, but eventually it'll be physical too. Which means we may eventually see limit orders for gallons of milk.\n\nThat means more reserve prices will be observable."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "The consumer just buys one gallon of milk at $3. They lack power to shift price.\n\nBut the enterprise buyer might buy 100 gallons of milk from the first store at $3, cleaning them out. Then 150 from the next store at $3.20, cleaning them out too. Now the price starts rising."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "In the post-crypto world, millions of people are directly interacting with order books every day. They can see that price is literally a function of supply and demand, of (price, quantity) pairs. They can see how prices arise. "}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "In the pre-crypto world, very few people interacted with order books. You bought a gallon of milk at the store for $3 and that was it. As a consumer, you were a price-taker. You only bought one unit at a time, for most things you bought. So, we didn't understand how prices arose."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Observation: in an order book, when you place a limit order to buy, you are revealing your reserve price.\n\nSuppose the market is at $100 per widget. You place a limit order for 10 widgets at $90. You are showing that you would not buy the 10 widgets if the price was above $90."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "The counterintuitive part of trade is that many people think it's zero sum. After all, one entity gains money and the other one \"loses it\", right?\n\nBut if we record (reserve.price - unit.price) + (unit.price - cost.of.production) for every trade, we get a different perspective."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "For every transaction where we can measure the reserve price *and* the cost-of-production, we can prove that it was wealth creating. \n\nBecause at least at that moment, both buyer &amp; seller profited from the trade to a *quantifiable* extent.\n\nA provable positive-sum relationship."}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "At first this is just standard consumer surplus. Gains from trade and all that.\n\nBut the interesting point is that the reserve price is usually an unobserved variable in most transactions, while the unit cost-of-production is usually known.\n\nCould we measure more reserve prices?"}
{"prompt": "", "completion": "In any voluntary transaction, both sides gain. How to quantify this?\n\nThe seller of a good measures their marginal profit: the price-per-unit minus the cost of production.\n\nThe buyer could measure *their* marginal profit by subtracting the price-per-unit from their reserve price."}

{"prompt": "", "completion": "But when headache appears to have been triggered by a spike-based COVID vaccine, it\u2019s a very different matter, especially if it is severe. I see four reasons to worry, but given the complexity of the systems in question, there could be others."}
